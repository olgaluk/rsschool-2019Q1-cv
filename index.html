        <h2>About myself</h2>
        <p>Since childhood, I dreamed of becoming a programmer, working with computers. I had little idea what it was,
          but I liked the general atmosphere. I went to the school programming circle, but this did not give me much: I
          had to strictly follow every word of the teacher and thoughtlessly press the buttons strictly on command and
          only those that said it was uninteresting. Since at that time the teachers themselves were just learning and
          could not really explain anything. Therefore, I was attracted more by mathematics and later I entered the
          Faculty of Mathematics.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I think this is a great base for a programmer. It develops such qualities as attentiveness to details, the
          ability to decompose a task, draw up a solution algorithm, establish causal relationships. And most
          importantly, to find the pleasure of studying and designing complex things, from each solved problem.</p>
        <br>
        <p>At this point in time, I consider myself an ideal candidate for this work. Since I have a great desire to
          obtain new knowledge and the ability to quickly assimilate them, a certain amount of knowledge behind my back,
          I know for sure who I want to be and what I want.</p>
